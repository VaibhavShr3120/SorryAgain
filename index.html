I know the things got messed up because of me and all the misunderstandings that are created were only because of me, I'd have asked and make things clear and sorted on 4th feb itself. I know the things got messed up and I'm really very sorry for that I shouldn't have said that word but that one misunderstanding messed the things up from my side. But everything that happened was because of that one misunderstanding. And just think for while agar mujhe gaali deni hi hoti to don't you think I should've said a more worse word than that. Agar mujhe gaali us din bhi gaali deni hi hoti to fr m gaali dena chhodta hi kyu, aur mere saath to aur bhi kitne jyada frustrating cheezein huyi h aur mene us time pr bhi gaali ni di then m us din bhi kyuu hi deta agr vo ek misunderstanding create ni huyi hoti to.
      I know vo misunderstanding bhi mere side se hi create huyi thi mujjhe pehle se hi sort out krke rakh lenachahiye tha. But trust me agr vo misunderstanding bhi agr ni huyi hoti to m vo word bhi ni bolta. I know you'reupset with me and hurt but trust me i didn't do that intentionally. Meri bhut badi galti huyi m maan rha hu butsirf ek misunderstanding ki vjah se please mujhe itni badi saza mt do. Our bond really do matters to me alotand i can't lose our bond. Please try to understand.
      Before moving to next step please turn on your mobile volume and plug in your earphones and i want to dedicate each and every line of that song to our bond.`;
